# Order of Battle Addin

  The Order of Battle Widget organizes data layers (units and equipment) into hierarchical structures using a schema defined for military features.  While the tool is designed to represent military units and equipment, any features adhering to the military features schema for units and equipment may be represented in the Order of Battle widget.
