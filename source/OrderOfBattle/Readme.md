# Range Fan Addin

  The main function of this addin is to create range fans for features from the bearing, traversal, and range specified in the configuration of the widget. The addin also allows for managing the fans that are created with a widget containing of list of the features that have fans.  You can remove a range fan from the widget using the feature action remove fan.  This addin is contains a widget and two feature actions for the [Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/).  If the datasource is dynamic the range fan will update as the features location changes.
