### General Help

* [New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

### Getting Started with the Solution Widgets (WPF)

* Building
    * To Build Using Visual Studio
        * Open, build, and add one of the addins to the Operations Dashboard
    *  To use MSBuild to build the solution
        * Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS 2012
        * `cd solutions-widgets-wpf\source\AllSolutionsWidgets`
        * `msbuild AllSolutionsWidgets.sln /property:Configuration=Release`
* Running Units Test to Verify Your Solution
    * Important Note: Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 is required to run the Unit Tests provided with the repository
    * Open and run the test solution at source\AllSolutionsWidgetsWithTests with the Visual Studio Test Explorer
    * See the Readme in the [Unit Test Solution](source/AllSolutionsWidgetsWithTests/Readme.md) for more information
* Running
    * Check the readme for each addin for more details about what each one does.
    * To run from Visual Studio:
        * Update Project Debug properties to correctly locate add-in build path in /addinpath command line argument. 
        * E.g. Command Line Arguments: `/addinpath:"{FULLY QUALIFIED PATH TO}\solutions-widgets-wpf\applications"`
    * To run from a command prompt:
        * `> cd solutions-widgets-wpf\applications`
        * `> C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS SDKs\WPF10.2\sdk\OperationsDashboard\OperationsDashboard.exe /addinpath:"{LOCAL PATH TO}\solutions-widgets-wpf\applications"`
    * When Operations Dashboard application starts, edit an Operation View settings to choose one of the addins
    * When ready to test the deployment to ArcGIS Online
        * Upload one or more of the .opdashboardaddin files from the solutions-widgets-wpf\applications directory to ArcGIS Online, and then download using Manage Add-Ins in Operations Dashboard

### Services

* There are several services that the addins depend on to function.  You can open, build, and run the test project TestDependentServices solution to check which services may not be available.
