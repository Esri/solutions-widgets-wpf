### Getting Started with the Solution Widgets (WPF)

* Building
    * To Build Using Visual Studio
        * Open, build, and add one of the addins to the Operations Dashboard
    * To use MSBuild to build the solution
        * Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS 2012
        * `cd solutions-widgets-wpf\source\AllSolutionsWidgets`
        * `msbuild AllSolutionsWidgets.sln /property:Configuration=Release`
    * IMPORTANT:  **If you run into issues building with IDE error.  Close Visual Studio and open .csproj file associated with the widget you are trying to compile.  Search for 10.2.2 and replace with the version of the Runtime SDK that you are using.  This should fix the problem.**
* Running Units Test to Verify Your Solution
    * Important Note: Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate or Premium Update 2 is required to build and run the Unit Tests provided with the repository
    * Open and run the test solution at source\AllSolutionsWidgetsWithTests with the Visual Studio Test Explorer
    * Alternately, use VSTest.Console.exe or MSTest.exe to run one of the test projects' dlls
        * e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow\VSTest.Console.exe" "solutions-widgets-wpf\application\OrderOfBattleUnitTests.dll"
    * See the Readme in the [Unit Test Solution](source/AllSolutionsWidgetsWithTests/Readme.md) for more information
* Running
    * Check the readme for each addin for more details about what each one does.
    * To run from Visual Studio:
        * Update Project Debug properties to
        * Start external program: e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS SDKs\WPF10.2.2\sdk\OperationsDashboard\OperationsDashboard.exe"
        * Correctly locate add-in build path and supply in command line arguments as /addinpath:"{PATH TO ADDIN}"
            * E.g. Command Line Arguments: /addinpath:"{FULLY QUALIFIED PATH TO}\solutions-widgets-wpf\applications"
    * To run from a command prompt:
        * > cd solutions-widgets-wpf\applications
        * > "C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS SDKs\WPF10.2.2\sdk\OperationsDashboard\OperationsDashboard.exe" /addinpath:"{LOCAL PATH TO}\solutions-widgets-wpf\applications"
    * When Operations Dashboard application starts, edit an Operation View settings to choose one of the addins
    * When ready to test the deployment to ArcGIS Online
        * Upload one or more of the .opdashboardaddin files from the solutions-widgets-wpf\applications directory to ArcGIS Online, and then download using Manage Add-Ins in Operations Dashboard

### Services

* There are several services that the addins depend on to function.  You can open, build, and run the test project [TestDependentServices](source/AllSolutionsWidgetsWithTests/TestDependentServices/TestDependentServices.cs) to check which services may not be available.

## Resources

* Learn more about the [Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/)
* Learn more about Esri's [ArcGIS for the Military](http://solutions.arcgis.com/military/).
* These widgets use [Esri's ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/runtime-wpf/);
see the site for concepts, samples, and references for using the API to create mapping applications.
